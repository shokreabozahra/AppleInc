                <p>SAN FRANCISCO — When Steven P. Jobs ran Apple, the company’s devices were distinguished by their polished software and famous iTunes store. Today, critics and even loyal fans are taking shots at Apple’s buggy software and Apple Music, its new streaming music service.

                    With its hardware sales now slowing, Apple is under pressure to fix its software and online services, which have become increasingly important to consumers. So at its annual conference for software developers on Monday, the iPhone maker tried to demonstrate that it was still a purveyor of high-quality software and services.
                    
                    Brian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple’s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.
                    
                    Apple announced:
                    
                    ■ Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.
                    
                    ■ Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.</p>

                    <p>Farhad: Apple divided its presentation into four segments focused on each of its computer operating systems — one each for iPhone, the Mac, the Apple Watch and Apple TV.

                        That segmentation suggests Apple’s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.</p>
